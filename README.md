Eleph: Yet Another Mastodon Client for Android!

Eleph is:
- a native Android app written (mostly) in Kotlin
- free and open source (GPLv3)
- ad free forever

## Why?
"Does the world really need another Mastodon client when there are already
several good ones available?" you might ask. No, not really. 

### The world needs racial justice, rights for trans* and GNC
### individuals, concerted global effort on climate change, and nuclear
### disarmament.

But I need a project to put in my portfolio so I can get a (better) job, so here
we are!

## Goals
Eleph **shall** be:
 - free to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve
 - completely ad free

Eleph *should* be:
 - simple
 - reliable
 - written in idiomatic Kotlin

Additionally, Eleph aims to:
 - be as minimally invasive as possible
 - require the minimum permissions necessary
 - have a clean, minimalist interface

## We also have a Mastodon instance
Anyone can use Eleph for any purpose. Anyone who so chooses may also sign up for
an account on our Mastodon instance, https://eleph.social
If you do sign up for an eleph.social account, you must abide by the instance's
rules. Eleph invites new users to create an account on eleph.social, but this is
offered as a convenience for people new to Mastodon. **You do not need an
eleph.social account to use Eleph**

### Everyone is welcome to contribute

Eleph is being created as a hobby project and a labor of love. You are welcome
